# Lostinspace Bot 3001
Welcome to Lostinspace Bot 3001! Brave the many dangers of space to reach your ship's destination or die trying... 

Your ship exists in a space grid, use reactions to determine which way the ship moves, but keep an eye on your fuel, provisions and hull integrity because if any of them drop to 0 then you die you lose 10 fuel every time you move and once you've visited a place you can see that place on the map.


You can have different types of encounters while exploring the galaxy:


Planets: you have a chance to either gain or lose provisions

Ships: you have a chance to either gain fuel or lose hull

Black holes: you spend extra fuel

Portals: you get transported to a random location in the map

Space stations: you get an increase in your lowest resource

Debris: you have a chance to either gain or lose hull

Higher Beings: you have a chance to either gain a tremendous amount of resources or instantly die
